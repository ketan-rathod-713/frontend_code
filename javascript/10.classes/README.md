# Javascript and Classes

- Programming styles nothing but a way of writting code. Some prefer to write code using the object oriented approach and some like functional or other way.

- Javascript technically doesn't support the classes.

- Earlier javascript didn't have the ability to define classes. Classes were added in EC6. 

- It is important to note that javascript is primarily a prototype based language. and it's classes are just a syntacticall sugar over existing prototype based inheritance mechanism. Behind the scene it works differently.

## Object

- toLowerCase, toUpperCase, Date, etc. are objects or their properties
