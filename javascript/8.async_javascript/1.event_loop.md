# Async Javascript

By default javascript engines are synchronous. And runs on a single threads. Later on they are provided with the environment and given the extra api's to make it asynchronous.

This API's are called as web API's. It consists of DOM API's in case of browser and setTimeout, setInterval, fetch() etc. This all api's registers a callback functions in them. And whenever that event is called, this api's put that callback functions in the task queue. Which is later on then taken by the javascript engine to run.

For the fetch api, later on new queue came which is also called as high priority queue. Which consists of promises and all that stuff.

Hence this are just a bunch of API's which are given to the javascript engine to behave asynchronously.
