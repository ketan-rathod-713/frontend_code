    Define the script to run 
    This is where we define that react will be injected by adding this main.jsx javascript file.
    It will render a jsx into this html element. 

    Why using this method ?
    We are able to write the html using javascript -> so now html has a programmaing capabilities which can help us to write complex logics easily.

    Can i load two micro react applications in single html page ? and is it even exists ?
